# United States Population Estimates, 2019
Urijah Morrison

## Introduction
This web map represents the population of all 50 states using the US Census Bureau Population Estimates for 2019. It is a proportional symbol map, with the circles representing the size of the population of that state. By doing this we are able to compare the population sizes of each state by the symbol rather than having to look at the actual population figure. In order to do this we used an ordinal data file which listed each state, its location in long, lat format, along with their corresponding population estimate which comes in a csv file from the US Census Bureau. By converting this file from csv to geoJSON format we are able to use it in our web map. The proportional symbol circles are colored orange so that they are more visible, and when you hover your mouse over a states circle it is shaded blue so you can see that it's the state you have selected.
